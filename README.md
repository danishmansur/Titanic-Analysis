# Titanic-Analysis


A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This was my first project in Data Science. The titanic and titanic2 data frames describe the survival status of individual passengers on the Titanic. The titanic data frame does not contain information from the crew, but it does contain actual ages of half of the passengers.
In this project, I will try to answer three questions:

  1. Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc) 
  2. What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class? 
  3. Where did the passengers come from? 
  4. Who was alone and who was with family?
  5. 5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?

I have answered these questions with the help of various visualizarions including kde plots.
